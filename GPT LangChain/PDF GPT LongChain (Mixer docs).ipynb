Follow the recommended quantities, \\nprocessing time, and speed as i ndicated in the owner ’s manual. Do NOT exceed suggested processing \\nspeed, doing so could harm the appliance.  \\nControls  \\nUse the speed dial to select your desired speed. NOTE: The Rev/Zero and Scale/Timer buttons are one \\nsingle button with two functions that  should be pressed in the middle. NOTE: Make sure the speed dial is \\nOFF when not in use, before unplugging, and before locking the bowl lift.  \\nParts Included:  \\n1. Control Panel 2. Speed dial 3. OLED Screen and Led progress Light bar 4. Speed Settings 5. Accessory \\nPort 6. Attachment output shaft 7. Bowl Pins 8. Bowl Lift Arms 9. Bowl Carrier 10. Power Cord 11. Bowl \\n12. Wire Whisk 13. Commercial Grade stainless ste el beater 14. Commercial grade steel dough hook 15. \\nBowl shield.  \\nSpeed Chart  \\nNOTE: DO NOT use the dough hook above speed two Doing so could result in product failure.  \\nNOTE: DO NOT use the reverse function with third party attachments. NOTE: The Profile Sm art Mixer is \\ncompatible with KitchenAid attachments.  \\nTips  \\nTo avoid splatter, always increase speed gradually.  \\nBatter:  \\nWhen making cake batter with the beater attachment, be careful to not over beat the batter. This can \\nadd extra air into the batter and cause the cake to mound in the center and crack while breaking.  \\nWhisking:  \\nAlways make sure your bowl and attachments are clean and dry when you are whisking egg whites or \\nwhipping cream. The weather can affect your egg whites. Humidity can make it difficu lt to create the stiff \\nwhite peaks due to moisture in air. A great way to create whipping cream is to chill the 11 -wire whisk and \\nbowl in your refrigerator for 20 -30 minutes before whisking.  \\nDough:  \\n It is sometimes helpful to start blending your dough wit h the beater attachment until a loose dough is \\nformed. Then switching the beater for the dough hook. This is not a required step but can be helpful \\nwith wet doughs. Make sure to stay at the recommended dough speed to prevent over kneading. Use \\nthe dough ho ok to knead yeast dough for bread and pizzas. Frequent scraping of the bowl will prevent \\nthe dough from sticking to the bottom of the bowl or climbing the dough hook, especially when you \\nhave very wet dough.  \\n Using your smart mixer  \\n1) Make sure the mixer i s unplugged and turned off . 2) Lower the bowl lift arms by pressing down on the \\narms . 3) Place the bowl into the bowl arms and align on pins.

See the speed chart on page 9 for a guide on attachment use.  5) When the bowl and \\nare in place, ra ise the bowl arms by slowly pushing up on arms until they lock into place. 6) Slide the \\nbowl shield onto the bowl if desired. 7) Plug the mixer into an outlet. 8) Use the speed dial and turn to \\nyour desired speed. When finished, turn back to the mixing OFF  position. 9) Pull down on the quick \\nchange to release your attachment. 10) Unplug the mixer from the outlet.  \\nSmart Mixer Settings:  \\nNOTE: If your smart mixer is plugged in and not turned on, press any button to wake up the machine.  \\nSpeed Control:  \\nThe Sp eed Control allows the user to set their speed by rotating the speed dial between stir and 11. \\n\"Ready\" will appear on the screen when the mixer is turned on.
