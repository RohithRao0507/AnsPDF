Fault  Description : This fault is set if the motor shaft speed \\nexceeds 45 RPM for 5 seconds while in spin mode and unlocked. This fault can also occur if the basket is \\nmanually spun by hand. Repair Action : Check the lid lock using service mode spin test 14. Check lid lock \\nharness connectors both at the main board and at the lid lock assembly. Measure the resistance at \\nmotor connector between each motor phase winding and ground (green/ yellow wire). Ensure that it is \\nan open circuit.  \\nFault Code : 2. Fault Name : Lid Monitor. Fault Description : Control did not get lid closed signal from \\nswitch while motor was moving. Could mean the switch didn’t close or control didn’t get the signal \\nbecause of lack of connection. Repair Action : Replace lid lock if this happens frequently.  \\nFault Code : 3. Fault Name : Locked Rotor Monitor. Fault  Description : For 5 straight seconds control not \\nseeing signal changes indicating the motor is turning while trying to spin. Could mean the motor isn’t \\nrotating or the control didn’t get the signal because of  lack of connection. Repair Action : Physically check \\nthe washer for anything preventing motor movement. Measure the resistance of each motor phase \\nwinding. Make sure resistances match the values on the wiring diagram. Verify hall sensor is connected \\nto the  main harness. Put washer in service mode and run test 14 (Spin). If hall sensor is bad or \\ndisconnected, the basket will start to spin normally and then stop spinning after approximately 5 \\nseconds. Ensure hall sensor is properly connected and positioned on  the motor. If basket spins for \\napproximately 15 seconds, the hall sensor is most likely NOT the cause. For belt and pulley drives, check \\nthat the microfarads of the start capacitor matches the value on the wiring diagram. TCO should reset in \\napproximately  45 minutes. If TCO is tripped, make sure motor moves freely and that nothing is jamming \\nit. Replace motor if it does not. If direct drive, replace inverter board. If belt and pulley drive, replace \\nmain board.  \\nFault Code : 4. Fault Name : Reset Monitor. Faul t Description : Control is resetting the software by itself \\ndue to criteria it believes could resolve itself upon reset. Repair Action : This Fault can be set any time \\nthe unit is powered on including exiting service mode. No repair necessary.  \\nFault Code : 5. Fault Name : Mode Shifter. Fault  Description : Control didn’t see the transition from \\nAgitate to Spin or vice -versa in the time required. Could mean the shift didn’t occur or control didn’t get \\nthe signal because of lack of connection. Repair Action : If lid  does not lock use service mode test 13 to \\nconfirm lid switch is functional. Use service mode test 14 to put the unit into spin mode. Check \\nresistance of the mode shifter motor. Make sure it matches the value on the wiring diagram. Check \\ncontinuity of the mode shifter switch. Check mode shifter coupler for damage and the ability to slide in \\nand out freely. Check for 120 VAC to the mode shifter motor at the control connector.  \\nFault Code : 6. Fault Name : Critical Flood Level by pressure. Fault  Description : Con trol received an \\nextended period of pressure readings that is nearing over -flow levels.

Repair Action: Run Drain & Spin cycle to ensure basket reaches final spin speed and the Spin LED does not blink. Check to make sure unit is firmly seated on all four legs, doesn't rock, and is leveled. Check that basket assembly is hanging centered up in lid opening. Check for proper rod and springs (color) and are properly seated. Check that hub nut is tight. Check that the rod and spring are dampening properly. Check the basket for excessive friction or for being excessively out of round. Basket should spin freely and without wobble. If friction is found, remove it. If basket is bad, replace it.\""
